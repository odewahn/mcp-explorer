```

### To package, sign, and notarize

I used this this tool, whih does all the steps in a nice package:

https://github.com/txoof/codesign

Note that I renamed it `pycodesign` when I downloaded it, even though it's called `pycodesign.py` when you download it from the repo.

```
cd dist
pycodesign ../pycodesign.ini
```

NB: Before you can notarize, you need to have a developer account with Apple and have set up the notarization process. This is a bit of a pain, but it's not too bad. You can find the instructions [here](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/security/notarizing_macos_software_before_distribution).
